erNotPlasticized.Cause=The plasticizing movement has not \u000areached its end or targetposition.
erNotPlasticized.Description=The operation desired by the user or cyclic-sequence cannot be performed \u000abecause plasticizing has not reached its end or targetposition.
erNotPlasticized.Resolution=Activate plasticizing to reach its end- or targetposition before \u000aretrying the desired operation.<br><br>\u000aIf this alarm occurs during semi- or full-autocycle check the \u000aplasticizing output settings ({Injection1.sv_PlastProfVis.Profile.Points[1].rRotation:c:backpressure} / {Injection1.sv_PlastProfVis.Profile.Points[1].rRotation:c:speed}) and if necessary adjust them to \u000aallow plasticizing to finish properly before restarting cyclic operation.<br>\u000aIt is also possible to check if the material feed has been interrupted.
