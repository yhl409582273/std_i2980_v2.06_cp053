erHighDiffAtPres.Cause=During pump pressure calibration the detected \u000apressure doesn't fit to the setting for maximum system pressure.
erHighDiffAtPres.Description=At the end of a automatic pump pressure calibration the measured maximum\u000a pressure is compared to the maximum system pressure setting. Those two values \u000ashould be rather similar. In case the variation is higher than 5% the warning alarm is \u000agiven.
erHighDiffAtPres.Resolution=Still all operations are possible, but taking a closer look at the system is strongly \u000asuggested.<br>\u000aCheck the maximum system pressure setting and adjust if necessary.\u000aThen recalibrate the pump pressure.\u000aConsider hardware issues and search for problem causes.
